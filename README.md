## Michael 👋

Self-taught, AI-assisted builder focused on creating practical tools for people navigating complex systems.

I build tools that help families navigate legal systems, stability barriers, and bureaucratic friction.

## 🚧 What I'm Building

### 🔹 Family Law Navigator
An Expo + TypeScript app mapping real statutes to real-life custody and dependency scenarios so people aren’t blindsided by the system.

### 🔹 The Father’s Alliance
A humanitarian infrastructure project focused on transportation stability, legal navigation, and resource coordination.

### 🔹 Cloudflare Workers + D1 Systems
Cost-minimized backend architecture built for resilience and accessibility.
